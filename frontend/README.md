# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Hello! Thank you for contacting our Namecheap support team. Could you please clarify your question? Are you asking if Namecheap supports MongoDB on its hosting services, or are you looking for assistance with setting up MongoDB? Let me know so I can assist you further.

yeah am asking if namecheap supports that database because last i only used mysql

02 Jul 2025, 9:58 PM


Namecheap does not support MongoDB on its Shared or Reseller hosting services. However,  can be installed on VPS (Virtual Private Server) or Dedicated servers offered by Namecheap. It is important to note that installing and managing MongoDB on these servers requires advanced technical skills, as Namecheap does not provide installation assistance for MongoDB.
If you are using Shared or Reseller hosting and need to connect to a MongoDB database, you can do so if the database is located on another server. The MongoDB port 27017 is open by default on Namecheap's Shared and Reseller servers, allowing you to connect to an external MongoDB server.
For those interested in using MongoDB, it is recommended to consider a VPS or Dedicated server if you have the necessary technical expertise to manage the installation and maintenance of the database.

what about your hosting services can i host my backend here together with frontend

02 Jul 2025, 10:00 PM


Yes, you can host both your backend and frontend on Namecheap hosting services. Namecheap offers a variety of hosting plans that can accommodate different types of web applications, including those with separate backend and frontend components.
For hosting both parts of your application, you can use Shared Hosting, VPS Hosting, or Dedicated Servers, depending on your specific needs and the scale of your project. Shared Hosting is suitable for smaller projects or personal websites, while VPS Hosting and Dedicated Servers provide more resources and control, making them ideal for larger applications or those requiring more customization and performance.
To host your backend and frontend, you can set up your frontend files (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) in the public directory of your hosting account, while your backend (such as server-side scripts or applications) can be configured to run on the server. If you are using a VPS or Dedicated Server, you have the flexibility to configure the server environment to meet the specific requirements of your backend technology, such as Node.js, Python, or PHP. Additionally, Namecheap's hosting services support various databases, which can be used to store and manage your application's data.

please which are those databases do you support

02 Jul 2025, 10:02 PM


Namecheap hosting services support several types of databases, depending on the hosting plan you choose. For Shared Hosting plans, Namecheap supports MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. These databases are commonly used with various content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. You can manage these databases using tools like phpMyAdmin for MySQL and phpPgAdmin for PostgreSQL, both of which are accessible through cPanel.
For Reseller Hosting plans, similar support is provided for MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. These plans also include tools like phpMyAdmin and phpPgAdmin for database management. Reseller Hosting allows you to create and manage multiple cPanel accounts, each with its own database setup.
If you opt for VPS or Dedicated Hosting plans, you have more flexibility and control over the software you can install, including databases. While MySQL and PostgreSQL are supported, you can also install other database systems like MongoDB, provided you have the necessary technical skills to manage and configure them. Note that MongoDB is not supported on Shared or Reseller servers, but it can be installed on VPS or Dedicated servers.
